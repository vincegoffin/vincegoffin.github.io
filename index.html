  <h1>Welcome to Lockdawn!</h1>
  <p>Hi there, I'm Vincent, from Belgium. You just landed on my blog, which is in construction at the moment, but a lot of content arrives soon. This blog is a repository of everything I've been writing, from old poetry dating as early as 2004 (if I remember correctly - in French) to newer stuff like data science and other programming things in the future. I also set up that blog to be able to write during these times of uncertainty and documenting the things happening around me.</p>
 <p>
    In the coming days, I'll be adding everything I have already written (this early XXIst century french poetry thing, and then other things, depending on mood and ideas. I'll tag things accordingly so people don't get lost in everything there is here). It'll normally be divided according to year, month and day of writing where known.
 </p>
